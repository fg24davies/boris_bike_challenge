# Boris Bikes

A series of challenges to create a simple program that emulates the docking stations, bikes and infrastructure of the London Boris/Santander Cycle system.

This project was part of week 1 Maker's Academy boot camp. The aim was to practise pair programming with navigator/driver style and Test-Driven-Development.

There were 22 challenges, I have completed 18 challenges so far. 

Code is written in Ruby-standard-style

Tests on code can be run in RSpec

Partnered on this projects at various points with @LouBallantyne, @StuBehan and @WillSpencer
